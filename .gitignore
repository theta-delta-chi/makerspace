# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore database config files, committing passwords is a sin.
/config/database.yml

# Ignore server setup files
.htaccess
.scripts-version

# Taken from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Rails.gitignore

# ## Environment normalization:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle
#
# # these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# # Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset
#
# # unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
